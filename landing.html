                <big>P</big>rior to getting to know what Organic Farming is, we need to revisit the foundation of Organic Farming to understand why the most conventional way of farming is being diminished and why Organic Farming is being adopted by the masses.
                
                <br><br>

                <big>F</big>arming is the activity of growing crops or keeping animals on a farm. Farming, and Agriculture in general, started thousands of years ago. The development of farming gave rise to the Neolithic Revolution as people gave up Nomadic hunting and became settlers in cities. Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew. One of the major adversities of modern mehods of farming is the excessive use of chemicals and pesticides in order to prevent harm to crops. The excess of pesticide and chemicals are in turn harming the crops and their consumers. That is why, we have turned towards Organic Farming and are reasearching and studying more on this methodology.

                <br><br>

                <big>O</big>rganic Farming, AKA Economic Farming, is an agricultural system that uses fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Organic agricultural methods are internationally regulated and legally enforced by many nations, based in large part on the standards set by the <i><u>Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM)</i></u>, an international umbrella organization for organic farming organizations established in 1972. Its mission is to, "Lead, unite and assist the organic movement in its full diversity." and vision is the "worldwide adoption of ecologically, socially and economically sound systems, based on the Principles of Organic Agriculture". It also suggests four basic principles on which organic farming is based: Health, Ecology, Fairness and Care.
                
                <br><br>

                <b>Health</b>: Organic farming should improve soil health thus sustaining plants, animals, humans as well as the planet.<br>
                <b>Ecology</b>: Organic farming should support natural cycles, living systems and help in sustaining them.<br>
                <b>Fairness</b>: It should be built on strong relationships that encourage fairness concerning the environment, social justice and fair trade.<br>
                <b>Care</b>: Organic farming should be done with responsibility, considering the environment and future generations. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                One of the major purpose, amongst many, of Organic Farming is to promote high-quality food production in vast quantity by boosting soil fertility, reducing pollution, avoiding the use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, protecting genetic diversity and enhancing the natural farming system cycles. Organic Farming also highly encourages sustainable development.
