                As organic farming has types under these types are there are certain methods or techniques which are followed for a better approach. It mainly focuses on producing crops with a high nutritional value.

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Crop Rotation</b>: Crop rotation is the cultivation of different types of crops on the same piece of land over time. Crop rotation is carefully designed and is practiced ensuring the soil nutrients are under control, pest controllers, weeds are also suppressed which built the soil health. Crop rotation also meets the market demands efficiently and more swiftly. It is a very beneficial farming technique that replenishes the soil naturally as different plants contribute different nutrients to the soil. This technique helps control pests, weeds, insects, etc. by disrupting their habitat.</li>
                    <li><b>Green Manure</b>: Green Manure is a method under which plants which are died or have lost lie and uprooted and are turned into soil for improving the fertility of the soil which is referred to as green manuring and the manure which is obtained by this method is called the green manure. Organic farming emphasises the introduction of plant or animal-based products that are nutritionally dense. Some green manuring crops are soybean, moong, groundnut, lemongrass, and other wild grasses.</li>
                    <li><b>Compost</b>: In organic farming, compost is one of the most effective natural fertilizers. It's nutrient-rich recycled organic matter that improves soil quality and crop yield. Compost is one of the best natural fertilizers used in organic farming. It is a recycled organic matter highly enriched with nutrients that enhance the soil quality and improve crop production.</li>
                    <li><b>Crop Diversity</b>: Crop diversity refers to both the planting of multiple crops. Crop diversification improves our food supply's genetic diversity. This is especially important for crops that make up a huge portion of global food consumption. Organic farming promotes intercropping, which allows the cultivation of different crops to meet market demands and revive the soil. A new practice named <b>Polyculture</b> is in trend these days. In polyculture, a variety of crops can be cultivated simultaneously to fulfill the increasing demand for food items across the world.</li>
                    <li><b>Soil Management</b>: Organic farming's main goal is to improve soil quality by using natural methods. That is why organic farming emphasizes the utilization of bacteria (found in animal feces) to help boost the soil's nutrient levels, making it more fertile for increased production. Soil management involves the use of natural fertilisers for replenishing the nutrients of the soil after every subsequent cropping season. Organic farming also uses crop rotation patterns to increase the fertility of the soil. Soil is the primary requirement of cultivation. The soil depletes its quality as it loses its nutrients after the cultivation of crops. Hence, soil management is crucial to recharge the soil with the necessary nutrients.</li>
                    <li><b>Weed Management</b>: On the plant, weeds or wild grasses grow unnecessarily. These weeds suck up most of the nutrients in the soil, affecting crop output. As a result, organic farming employs ways to minimize the growth of such weeds. In organic farming, weed management discourages the use of chemical weedicides. However, pulling out the weeds mechanically require a lot of labour and is inefficient. Hence, organic farming recommends the use of natural weedicides by mowing or cutting and mulching. <br> Mulching, mowing or cutting are two techniques mainly we use for weed management in organic farming. In mulching, the farmers use plant residue or plastic films on the soil surface to block the growth of weeds. On the other hand, mowing or cutting is a process that works on the removal of weeds to minimize its growth in the field. Thus, weed management techniques help to improve the growth of the crop.</li>
