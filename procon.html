                    <li><b>Economical</b>: Organic Farming requires only a modest outlay including all the equipments as there are no pesticides, HYV seeds, or expensive fertilisers used.</li>
                    <li><b>Good Return on Investment</b>: With the usage of cheaper and local inputs, a farmer can make a good return on investment over time.</li>
                    <li><b>On High Demand</b>: There is a huge demand for organic products in India and across the globe, which generates more income through export and Overseas Marketing.</li>
                    <li><b>Nutritional</b>: As compared to chemical and fertiliser-utilised products, organic products are more nutritional, tasty, and good for health.</li>
                    <li><b>Environment-friendly</b>: The farming of organic products is free of chemicals and fertilisers, so it does not harm the environment.</li>
                    <li><b>Increased Immunity to Pests</b>: Organic farms are resistant to pests, weeds, and diseases because they are typically kept without the use of pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers. The increase in pest resistance also helps to reduce production costs for organic farmers.</li>
                    <li><b>Ability to grow more Variety of crops</b>: Organic farming can help farmers grow more variety in a shorter amount of time through methods such as crop rotation, composting, and animal breeding to make the land more productive without using any artificial fertilisers or pesticides.</li>
                    <li><b>Sustainable</b>: In contrast to conventional farming, organic farming is more sustainable for the future because its more environmentally friendly and less destructive to the land.</li>

            <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Incompetent</b>: The major issue of organic farming is the lack of inadequate infrastructure and marketing of the product.</li>
                    <li><b>Shorter shelf life</b>: Organic products have more flaws and a shorter shelf life than that of chemical products definitely due to the added preservatives that are included in the chemicals and not in the natural genuine products.</li>
                    <li><b>Large Initial Investment</b>: Organic farming is an expensive business. As the organic farmer makes more money,they can invest in new equipment for the farm. Organic farming can also be difficult because fertilisers, pesticides and other chemicals cannot be used to maintain the health or fend off pests from crops.</li>
                    <li><b>Requires considerable Efforts in Marketing</b>: The biggest disadvantage is the lack of marketing for organic produce which makes it difficult to compete with conventional crops and less profitable in terms of revenue.</li>
