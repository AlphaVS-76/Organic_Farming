                <big>T</big>he idea and the concept of Organic Farming originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices.
                <br>
                The use of the term "Organic" popularized by <b>Howard</b> and <b>Rodale</b> refers more narrowly to the use of organic matter derived from plant compost and animal manures to improve the humus content of soils.
                <br><br>
                In India, it was practiced since thousand of years. The great Indian civilization thrived on organic farming and was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, till the British ruled it. In traditional India, the entire agriculture was practiced using organic techniques, where the fertilizers, pesticides, etc., were obtained from plant and animal products. The cow, not only provided milk, but also provided bullocks for farming and dung which was used as fertilizers.
                <br><br>
                As we know, one of the Founding Father of the emergence of Organic Farming, <u>Sir Albert Howard</u>, Visited India and gained much inspiration from the traditional and sustainable farming practices he encountered there and advocated for their adoption in the West. Such practices were further promoted by various advocates—such as <u>J.I. Rodale</u> and his son <u>Robert</u>, in the 1940s and onward, who published <i>Organic Gardening and Farming</i> magazine and a number of texts on organic farming. The demand for organic food was stimulated in the 1960s by the publication of <i>Silent Spring</i>, by <u>Rachel Carson</u>, which documented the extent of environmental damage caused by insecticides.
                <br><br>
                Following this boom in Famring, The term <b>"eco-agriculture"</b> was coined in 1970 by <u>Charles Walters</u>, founder of <i>Acres Magazine</i>, to describe agriculture which does not use "man-made molecules of toxic rescue chemistry", effectively another name for Organic Farming.
